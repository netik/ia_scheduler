1. Pick bands in spotify.
2. Export your spotify account at http://www.spotmybackup.com
3. This will give you a json file, rename that and stick in data/spotify.json

Then, run ./run_me.sh.

Follow the instructions!
Edit schedule.txt to make sense. the format NEEDS to be:

^LDATE                  <== note the control-L on the date(!)
VENUE
xx:xx BAND
xx:xx BAND
   ... 
xx:xx BAND

VENUE
xx:xx BAND
xx:xx BAND
   ... 
xx:xx BAND

Remove any extraneous text. Spot check it against the schedule so that
the band names and times are right. PDFMiner isn't 100% perfet.
